  "description": "When alliances between humans and orcs are sealed by marriages, half-orcs are born. Some half-orcs rise to become proud chiefs of orc tribes, their human blood giving them an edge over their full-blooded orc rivals.

Many of these become adventurers, achieving greatness for their mighty deeds and notoriety for their barbaric customs and savage fury.",
